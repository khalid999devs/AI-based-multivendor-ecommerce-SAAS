## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
|   API Gateway     | ---> |   Auth Service    | ---> |   User Service    |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         |                        |                           |
         v                        v                           v
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
| Product Service   |      | Order Service     |      | Payment Service   |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
         |                        |                           |
         v                        v                           v
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
| AI Recommendation |      | Notification Svc  |      | Vendor Mgmt Svc   |
+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+
```

- **Each service** is independently deployable and communicates via lightweight APIs or message queues.
- **AI modules** are integrated as separate services for recommendations, search, and analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for local microservices)

### Clone & Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/eashop.git
cd eashop
npm install
```

---

### ‚ö° Setting Up with Nx

[Nx](https://nx.dev/) is a powerful monorepo tool that helps manage and scale your microservices architecture efficiently.

#### Install Nx CLI globally (optional but recommended):

```sh
npm install -g nx
```

#### Useful Nx Commands

- **Run a service in development:**
  ```sh
  npx nx serve <service-name>
  ```
- **Build a service for production:**
  ```sh
  npx nx build <service-name>
  ```
- **Run tests for a service:**
  ```sh
  npx nx test <service-name>
  ```
- **List all available projects:**
  ```sh
  npx nx show projects
  ```
- **Visualize project dependencies:**
  ```sh
  npx nx graph
  ```

For more, see the [Nx documentation](https://nx.dev/).

### Run Services

Start a service (e.g., auth):

```sh
npx nx serve auth-service
```

Or run all services with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Build for Production

```sh
npx nx build <service-name>
```

## For setting the replicated db (prisma working for mongodb)

1. run window powershell as administrator: mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath "C:\data\db"
2. in cmd prompt run: mongosh --host localhost --port 27017
3. in mongosh run: rs.initiate()
4. in mongosh run: rs.status()
5. to stop current replica set run: rs.stepDown()
6. to stop current mongod run: net stop MongoDB
